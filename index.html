  <div class="intro">
    <p>I’m a <strong>Design Systems Specialist</strong> based on the outskirts of London.</p>

    <p>If you live in the UK, you’ve probably interacted with something I’ve designed.</p>

  </div>

  <p>I was part of the founding team of the internationally recognised <strong>GOV.UK Design System</strong>. I have gone on to be the design lead for design systems at <strong>BT</strong> and <strong>Lloyds Banking Group</strong>, creating multi-theme systems for their high-value, household-name brands.</p>

  <p>I work at the intersection of Design, Accessibility, Engineering and Product Strategy. I enjoy delving into Design Tokens and Component APIs, as well as shaping UI libraries, high-level patterns, team structures and roadmaps.</p>
