<h1>The ‘Amen break’ is the ultimate design pattern</h1>

    <p class="lede">Back in the late 60s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_C._Coleman">Gregory Sylvester “G. C.”
Coleman</a>, the drummer of
Washington DC funk and soul band The Winstons recorded a drum interlude that
changed the world&hellip;</p>
</div>
<p>The Winstons released the single ‘Color Him Father’ in 1969, however it was the
6 second long drum break on the b-side ‘Amen, brother’ that would later become
the backdrop to thousands of tracks and define entire genre of music.</p>
<h3>The break</h3>
<p>The YouTube link below will drop you into ‘Amen, brother’ at 1:26. At the point
of reading this you either already know what you’re going to hear or you don’t.</p>

<p class="caption">The Winstons ‘Amen, Brother’ — Starting just before the ‘Amen break’</p>
<p>Stemming from breakbeat hardcore, hip-hop, reggae and ragga influences in early
90s rave culture, drum &amp; bass, jungle and breakcore would be somewhat defined by
this drum pattern, if not the sample of the this 6-second break itself. However
this was far from the first time the ‘Amen break’ was used to create new music.</p>
<h3>Sampling and 80s hip-hop</h3>
<p>In the mid-to-late 80s, two things happened that set the ‘Amen break’ on it’s
course to be the worlds most used drum sample.</p>
<p>The track ‘Amen, brother’ was included in the first official “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Breaks_and_Beats">Ultimate breaks
and beats</a>”
compilation, a series that would become legendary amongst beat juggling and
scratch DJs. These tracks were hand picked, containing the best drum breaks for
DJs to live loop over using two turntables.</p>
<p>When affordable digital samplers came a long, they allowed budding producers to
sample, loop, edit and manipulate samples from other tracks and found material.</p>
<p>Mix the two things together and you have a recipe for the ‘Amen break’ to become
one of the most commonly used beats in late 80s hip-hop.</p>
<p>Prior to the jungle and drum &amp; bass producers speeding the break up, hip-hop
producers slowed it down. NWA’s ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=41&amp;v=TMZi25Pq3T8">Straight Outta
Compton</a>’ is one
of the most famous tracks to use a heavily slowed down sample of the ‘Amen
break’ but it’s not as immediately recognisable as in some other tracks of the
time. On the track ‘Keep it going now’ by Rob Base &amp; DJ EZ Rock you can really
hear the pitch of that trademark snare drum cutting through the mix.</p>

<h3>Drum and bass and beyond</h3>
<p>There’s simply too many drum and bass tracks to mention that use the ‘Amen
break’. The four bars have been used in their original form, albeit sped up on
hundreds, if not thousands of tracks.</p>
<p>The break has also been heavily chopped up and re-arranged on both more
mainstream tracks like Shy FX’s classic ‘Original Nuttah’ and by underground
electronics producers like Venetian Snares and Luke Vibert (whose alter ego
‘Amen Andrews’ only makes tracks that contain the break).</p>
<p>Many of these tracks retain the core trademark sound of the original but put it
together in such different ways, using the break has become somewhat of an art
form in itself.</p>

<h3>How does this relate to design patterns?</h3>
<p>For context, I work at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/government-digital-service">Government Digital
Service</a>
as a designer on the team that looks after the <a href="http://www.gov.uk/design-system">GOV.UK Design
System</a> and it’s frontend codebase <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend">GOV.UK
Frontend</a>. We exist to provide teams
with design, code and guidance for the most commonly shared elements of
Government services. This allows teams to focus their time and effort on the
things that make their service different.</p>
<h4>GitHub is like a sample library</h4>
<p>Much like the “Ultimate breaks and beats” compilation, an open source repository
is like a free sample library for code. Anyone can look at our code, take it and
re-use it in a way that works for them.</p>
<p>For example, the team at NHS Digital were able to re-use the majority of <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend">GOV.UK
Frontend</a> in the newly released <a href="https://nhsuk.github.io/nhsuk-frontend/pages/examples.html">NHS
Frontend</a>. They kept
the bits that worked for them and changed the things that didn’t.</p>

<h4>Patterns can be adapted based on the use case, just like samples can be modified for different genres</h4>
<p>One of the most common push backs on design system’s and design patterns is that
they can be seen to limit a designer’s creativity or contain overly generic
solutions to specific problems.</p>
<p>I would argue that much like using sampled music, they simply give you a
starting point or set of constraints to work within. You can adapt or rearrange
a pattern to suit your use case, you can make it a prominent part of your design
or just let it sit in the background.</p>
<p>If a 6-second drum break from 1969 can be used as the backbone for over 3000
multiple genre spanning tracks, take some time to think about how design
patterns can be used to support your work and create new things, not just
restrict it.</p>
