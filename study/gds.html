    <h2>Government Digital Service</h2>
    <p><strong>Senior Interaction Designer</strong></p>
    <p>November 2016 – October 2019</p>
    
    <p>
      I spent my time at GDS as the interaction design specialist in the multi-disciplinary team 
      creating the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/design-system">GOV.UK Design System</a>. The system for hundreds, if not thousands of teams 
      building services on the GOV.UK domain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s not often you get to work on something where the audience is literally everyone. 
      I am incredibly proud of the work I did on the GOV.UK Design System and the impact it’s 
      had around the world.
    </p>
    <h3>Big wins (for the team):</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Pulled together multiple resources and years’ worth of design direction and knowledge into 
        a single, cohesive entry point
      </li>
      <li>
        Created a new open-source frontend library that has since been adopted and extended by 
        governments and public services all over the world.
      </li>
      <li>
        Got the system ready for the EU Accessibility Directive, auditing and adapting the Design 
        System against the newly introduced WCAG 2.1 AA standard
      </li>
      <li>
        Became a worldwide benchmark for accessibility and documentation, providing design systems 
        teams with best practice examples and sharing our research publicly
      </li>
      <li>
        Assisted in multiple contributions from designers and developers from other government departments
      </li>
    </ul>
