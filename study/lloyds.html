    <p><strong>Lead Product Designer (Design System)</strong></p>
    <p>November 2021 - Present</p>

    <p>
        Leading the design and strategic direction of the multi-brand design system ‘Constellation’ for one of the largest financial institutions in the UK.
    </p> 
    <p>   
        The Design System team has helped Lloyds go through a simultaneous digital transformation and brand re-positioning, while adapting their tooling and ways of working.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Just so you know:</strong> This case study is intentionally limited in scope because the design system is not public.</p>

            Supported the roll out of multiple, high value rebrands through multi-tiered system adoption

        <li>
            Created a system extension model to allow areas of the organisation to build on top of the central team’s work
