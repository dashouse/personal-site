      <h2>Big wins (for the team):</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Created a headless design system that retained the individuality and personality of each BT brand (BT, EE, Plusnet)
        </li>
        <li>
            Migrated hundreds of designers and engineers to a brand new system and ways of working
        </li>
        <li>
            Used the Design System to connect previously siloed areas of the organisation
        </li>
        <li>
            Developed a community “component blueprints” library as a way to share and iterate on component and pattern design before design system contribution
        </li>
        <li>
            As an Accessibility Guild member, I increased knowledge of accessible interface design within the design community
        </li>
      </ul>
